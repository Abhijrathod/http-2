# Net::HTTP2

Pure ruby implementation of HTTP 2.0 protocol: parsing, frame generation, header compression, etc. Current implementation is based on:

* draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-05
* draft-ietf-httpbis-header-compression-01

Since the underlying specifications are still evolving, treat the implementation as a work in progress as well! To get started, check out the specs directory. The library is designed for integration with client/server implementations.

Interested in contributing? There is plenty to do!

* +Session+ and +Stream+ interfaces
* Client/server implementations
* Better API documentation
