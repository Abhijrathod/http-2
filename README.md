## Net::HTTP2

Pure ruby implementation of HTTP 2.0 protocol: parsing, frame generation, header compression, and so on. Current implementation is based on:

* [draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-05](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-05)
* [draft-ietf-httpbis-header-compression-01](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-compression)

Since the underlying specifications are still evolving, treat this implementation as a work in progress as well!

To get started, check out the specs directory. The library is designed for integration with client/server implementations Interested in contributing? There is plenty to do!

* Session and Stream interfaces
* Client/server implementations
* Better API documentation
